## Wrangling data with `dplyr`

`dplyr` is the main package that we'll use for **manipulating** and
**transforming** datasets. The main kinds of transformations that we'll be
performing are:

1. Taking our **original dataset** and creating a **new** dataset that only has
   a **subset** of the **variables**/**columns** from the original dataset

2. Taking our **original dataset** and creating a **new** dataset that only has
   a **subset** of the **cases**/**rows** from the original dataset

3. Taking our **original dataset** and creating a **new** dataset that has an
   **additional** **variable**/**column** not in the original dataset 


The `dplyr` package has functions for performing all of these operations. 

For this tutorial, we're going to be using the **Palmer Penguins** dataset. The
dataset contains measurements from different different penguins including their
species (`species`), the island on which they were found (`island`), their bill
length (`bill_length_mm`) and depth (`bill_depth_mm`), the flipper length
(`flipper_length_mm`), their body mass (`body_mass_g`), their sex (`sex`), and
the year the measurement was made (`year`).

```

### Recap on **functions** and **objects**

Before we get started, we'll just have a recap of the last several tutorials
and practicals, just so that we can make sure that everyone is up to speed. 

#### Functions

Before we start using functions from `dplyr` let us just recap how to use
functions in `R`. Functions take **inputs** (or arguments) and produce
**outputs**. For all of the functions we'll cover in this section, one of the
**inputs** will be our original data (a tibble called `penguins` in this case)
and the output will be our new dataset which will be our transformed data. The
original dataset will always be fed into the input called `.data`. Remember
that you don't have to remember the argument names. You can just write the
function name open the brackets and then hit the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, and `R`
will show you a list of the arguments. 

#### Objects

Remember, objects, or variables, are bit of information stored in the computer
memory under a given label. We can **assign** the some data or content or a
variable using the assignment arrow `<-`. Below you can see and example of the
value (in this case, a string of letters) being assigned to a variable called
`var`.

```
var <- "a letter string"
```

Once this letter string has been assigned to the object called `var`, then you
can just access the content of that object using the label `var`. For example,
if you typed in `var` at the console and ran it you'd see the following:

```
> var
[1] "a letter string"
```

#### `tibbles`

Objects can hold many different types of data. For example, they could hold
strings of letters:

```
var <- "1 two three 4"
```

Or they could hold numbers, or vectors of numbers.

```
another_var <- 1
yet_another_var <- c(1,2, 3, 4)

```

And sometimes they can hold a table, which `R` calls a `tibble`

```
> my_tib
# A tibble: 4 x 2
   col1 col2
  <dbl> <chr>
1     1 one
2     2 two
3     3 three
4     4 four
```

In this tutorial, the data that we'll be working on will be in a `tibble`


### The `dplyr` functions

The `dplyr` functions that we'll be learning about are all specialised for
working with `tibble`s. They allow us to **do things will tibbles**. 

We haven't done much with `tibble`s before, but in earlier practicals we
learned that when we want to access a particular column from a tibble we used
the `$`. For example, if I wanted to get the column called `col1`, from the
`tibble` called `my_tib`, I'd write:

```
> my_tib$col1
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

Or if I wanted to take the values in `col1` of `my_tib` and multiply them by
12, I'd write:

```
> my_tib$col1 * 12
[1] 12 24 36 48
```

Notice how we have to specifically access the column using the name of the
tibble and the name of the column. The columns aren't **objects in their own
right**. They're **parts of an object**â€”the `tibble` called `my_tib`. 

But when it comes to working with `tibble`s and the `dplyr` functions,
something special happens. The `dplyr` functions allow us to go **inside** the
`tibble`. As you'll see, when we go **inside** a `tibble`, we can refer to
**columns in that `tibble`** *as if* they were objects in their own right. This
means we'll be referring to columns just using their names, so you won't see
any `$` any more. 


All the `dplyr` functions we'll learn about take a input of a `tibble` and
produce a `tibble` as the output. The `tibble` will become the basic unit of
data that we're working with. And the `dplyr` functions will allow us to go
**inside** the `tibble`, which will make working with them a lot easier. 


## Selecting

The first operation will learn about is taking our **original input tibble**
and **outputting** a tibble that only  has a subset of the **columns** from the
original. 

To do this, we'll use the function called `dplyr::select()`. Here is our
dataset again. We'll be using the `dplyr::select()` function on this dataset to
create a new one. 

```{r}
palmerpenguins::penguins
```

### Selecting a column

The first thing we'll do is selecting one columns. If the columns were
**objects in their own right** we could access a column just by using the
label/name of the column. 

With the `dplyr::select()` function we can do exactly the same!

We'll use `penguins` (our dataset) as the input to the `.data` argument of
`dplyr::select()`. `dplyr::select()` allows us to go **inside** `penguins` and
now we again simply access the columns of `penguins` by using their names. 

In the example below, we're selecting the `species` column from the `penguins`
dataset. Try running the code to see the output. 

```{r select_one_example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example"}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, species)
```

You'll see the output is still a `tibble`, but it only contains the coluns we
asked for. 

If you want a different column, you can just replace `species` with the name of
another column. Try completing the code below to select the `island` column. 

```{r select_one_ex, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r select_one_ex-hint-1}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, )
```

```{r select_one_ex-hint-2}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, island) #
```


Now try selecting the `year` column!

```{r select_one_ex2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r select_one_ex2-hint}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, )
```

```{r select_one_ex2-solution}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, year) 
```


For the last one, try selecting the `sex` column!

```{r select_one_ex3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r select_one_ex3-hint}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins,)
```

```{r select_one_ex3-solution}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, sex)
```


### Selecting multiple columns

Now that you've got the hang of selecting **one** column, we're going to try
selecting multiple columns! To select multiple columns we just list the names
of the columns we want. The example below selects the `year`, `species`, and
`island` column. Run the example to see the output.

```{r select_multi_example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example"}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, year, species, island)
```

Now try it out yourself. In the exercise below, try selecting the
`bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, and `flipper_length_mm` columns.

```{r select_multi_ex1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r select_multi_ex1-hint}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins,)
```

```{r select_multi_ex1-solution}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,flipper_length_mm)
```




### Dropping columns

Selecting columns works fine when we only want to keep a few columns. However,
sometimes we might want to keep **all but** a few columns from a dataset that
has many columns. Typing out all the column names for the columns we want to
keep can mean a lot of typing! But there is an easier way. Instead of typing
out the names of the columns we want to keep, we can instead just **drop**
columns. Dropping columns measurement that those columns won't be in our
output, but all the other columns will be. To **drop** a column we just put a
`-` in front of the column name.  In the next example, the new dataset will
contain all the columns in the original dataset **except** for the `species`
columns. 

```{r drop_one_example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example"}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, -species)
```

Now try it out yourself. In the exercise below, trying dropping the `year` column. 

```{r drop_one_example_ex1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r drop_one_example_ex1-hint}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, )
```

```{r drop_one_example_ex1-solution}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, -year)
```




You can also drop **multiple** columns. You just need to put a `-` in front of
the name of each column you want to drop. In the next exercise, try dropping
the `year` and the `island` column. 

```{r drop_one_example_ex2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r drop_one_example_ex2-hint}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, )
```

```{r drop_one_example_ex2-solution}
dplyr::select(.data = penguins, -year,-island)
```




## Filtering

Now that you've got the hang of selecting, we're going to try an new operation.
This new operation is filtering! 

To explain filtering, we'll look at a non-`R` example. Let's say you're a
school teacher, and you have a classroom full of kids. Some of the kids are
girls, some are boys, some of them are good at maths, some are struggling, and
some are good at reading, and others are struggling. You can all this
information written down in a table. Each row of the table is for one child.
You have a column that has the child's name, and then you have columns that
hold information about whether that child is a boy or  girl, another column
holds that child's math score (a number out of 100), and another column holds
their reading score (a number out of 100). 

You've decided that you'll run a special class for the students that are
struggling in maths. You go through the table looking at the numbers in the
maths column. For each time you see a score below 60 you write that child's
details in a new table. You write down their name, their gender, their maths
score, and their reading score in columns just the same as they are in the
original table. At the end of this, you'll have your original table, but you'll
also have a new table that you made. This process, of creating a new table that
only includes children that have maths scores below 60, is **filtering**. 

The aim of this section is to learn how to use the `dplyr::filter()` function
to instruct `R` to perform an operation like the one I just described. 

Just like with the `dplyr::select()` function, the `dplyr::filter()` function
has a argument called `.data` that will take our original tibble. 

Next, we'll just tell the function **how** we want the data filtered. 

Let's look at an example of `dplyr::filter()` in action. Here we'll be again be
working with our `penguins` `tibble`. To refresh, the `tibble` has information
about different penguins organised in columns. This includes a column called
`year`, that tells you what year the measurement was made. We want to
**filter** this, so that we only have measurements that were made in the year
2007 (This completely analogous to the example above, where we wanted to create
a new table that only had the children with maths scores below 60). To do, we
just write `year == 2007`. This means that we want the rows where the `year`
value is equal to the number 2007. 

If we put that all together, we get the example below. Run the example to see
the output. 

```{r filter_example_1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example 1"}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year == 2007)
```

We don't only have to use `==`, we can use **any** logical operation we want.
In the next example, we'll keep all the rows **except** those that have 2007 in
the year column. That is, we to look for values that are **not equal to** 2007.

```{r filter_example_2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example 2"}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year != 2007)
```

Now you're going to try it out yourself. In the exercise below, filter the
dataset so that it only contains the measurements that were made on the
`island` of **Torgersen**. Remember, we want to look for the letter string
**Torgersen**! Letter strings go in quotes, but labels (i.e., column labels)
don't go in quotes. 

```{r filter_ex1, exercise=TRUE}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex1-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex1-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, island )
```
```{r filter_ex1-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, island == "Torgersen")
```


Now try the opposite. Keep all the measurements that were made on an `island`
other than **Torgersen**.

```{r filter_ex2, exercise=TRUE}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex2-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex2-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, island )
```
```{r filter_ex2-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, island != "Torgersen")
```

In the first example we kept all the rows where the measurement was made in the
`year` 2007. In the next exercise, try keep all the measurements that were made
**after (but not including)** the `year` 2007.


```{r filter_ex3, exercise=TRUE}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex3-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex3-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year > 
```
```{r filter_ex3-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year > 2007)
```


### Matching on multiple conditions

We can also use `dplyr::filter()` to match more complex conditions. For
example, we might want to keep the rows that have measurements from the `year`
2007 **and** where the `sex` of the penguin was female. To do this, we'll just
join our two conditions `year == 2007` and `sex == "female"` with an `&`. Run
the example to see the output.

```{r filter_example_multi, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example 1"}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year == 2007 & sex == "female")
```

Or we might want to do something different like keep all the rows that have
that measurements from the `year` 2007 **or** where the `sex` of the penguin is
female. That is, if `year` is 2007 then we want regardless of what `sex`. And
if `sex` is female we want it regardless of what `year` is. Now we'd just join
`year == 2007` and `sex == "female"` with an `|`.

```{r filter_example_multi2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example 2"}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year == 2007 | sex == "female")
```


Now youâ€™re going to try it out yourself. In the next exercise, keep all the
cases where the measurements were made on the `island` of **Biscoe** and from
the `species` **Adelie**. 

```{r filter_ex4, exercise=TRUE}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex4-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```
```{r filter_ex4-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, island ==   & species == )
```
```{r filter_ex4-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, island ==  "Biscoe" & species == "Adelie")
```

Now try keep all the cases where the measurements were made after 2007 and on
islands other than the island of **Torgersen**.

```{r filter_ex5, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r filter_ex5-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year  & island )
```
```{r filter_ex5-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year >  & island != )
```
```{r filter_ex5-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year > 2007 & island != "Torgersen")
```


Now try keep all the cases where the measurements were made after 2007 or on
the island of **Torgersen**.

```{r filter_ex5a, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r filter_ex5a-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year | island )
```
```{r filter_ex5a-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year >  | island != )
```
```{r filter_ex5a-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, year > 2007 | island == "Torgersen")
```


### Matching on `NA`s

Finally, weâ€™re going to work with `dplyr::filter` and missing values. Youâ€™ll
notice that in the dataset there are a few rows where specific values are
missing. For example, in one row the value for `sex` is missing and instead it
contains an `NA`. Run the example to see how to filter the dataset to keep all
rows that have an `NA` in the `sex` column.

```{r match_na_example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example"}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, is.na(sex))
```

Now youâ€™re going to try it yourself. Keep all the rows that have an `NA` in the
`bill_length_mm` column. 

```{r filter_ex6, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r filter_ex6-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```

```{r filter_ex6-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, is.na())
```
```{r filter_ex6-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, is.na(bill_length_mm))
```

Now try the opposite. Keep all the rows that don't have have `NA` in the
`bill_length_mm` column. 

```{r filter_ex7, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r filter_ex7-hint-1}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, )
```

```{r filter_ex7-hint-2}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, !is.na())
```

```{r filter_ex7-solution}
dplyr::filter(.data = penguins, !is.na(bill_length_mm))
```


## Mutating

The last function we'll cover is the `dplyr::mutate()` function. To understand
what the `dplyr::mutate()` function, we'll use another non-`R` example. 

Let's say that you're working at a shop. You have a table of the inventory. In
this table, you have a column for the name of the produce and a column for the
price. You've decided that you want to discount the price of all the items in
the inventory by 10%. Do this, you make a copy of the table and then you add a
new column to it where you'll put in the new price. As you go through the table
you look at every price in the price column, you work out the 10% discount of
that price, and you write the new price in the new price column. At the end of
this, you have your original inventory table, and you have a new inventory
table that's the same as the original inventory table but with the new column
containing the discounted prices. The operation you've just performed is a
**mutate**.

Now let's get `R` to do the same thing. Again, we'll use the `penguins` data.
We'll take the `body_mass_g` column (body mass in grams) and we'll use the
values in there to create a new column called `body_mass_kg`, which will be the
body mass in kilograms. This means we'll just divide `body_mass_g` by 1000. To
do this, we'll just write `body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000`. Take a look at
the example below to see it in action.

```{r mutate_example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Example"}
dplyr::mutate(.data = penguins, body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000)
```

Now try it out yourself. Create a new column called `bill_volume` by
multiplying together the `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` columns.

```{r mutate_ex1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r mutate_ex1-hint-1}
dplyr::mutate(.data = penguins, bill_volume = )
```

```{r mutate_ex1-hint-2}
dplyr::mutate(.data = penguins, bill_volume =  * )
```

```{r mutate_ex1-solution}
dplyr::mutate(.data = penguins, bill_volume = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm)
```


## Summing up 

The best way to learn how to use these functions is to think about what you're
starting with and what you what you want to end up with (more columns, fewer
columns, fewer rows etc), and then use that to reason about what you need to
do. The operations you're performing are not any different to things you
would've done before. Even though the terminology might be alien, the
operations themselves are things you would've done countless times before in
everyday life. If you keep this in mind, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it
quickly.
